        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>
          CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper
          or in other media.

          <span id="cut">Css is not necessary</span>
          <span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the

    <h2 class="head itl">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div id="list2">
      <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>
          External - by using link elemtent to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in the external
          CSS files.<span class="bg">
            However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal
            styles,</span
          >
          because this is earlier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
          yourself.

      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand. applies a style to one
      unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p class="para space">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p class="para space">
      There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
      used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style
      should be applied.
